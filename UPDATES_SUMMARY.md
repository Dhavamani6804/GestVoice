    return (browser_back, [])

# File operations
elif 'save' in command_lower and 'as' not in command_lower:
    return (save_file, [])

# Window management
elif 'snap left' in command_lower:
    return (snap_window_left, [])

# Virtual desktops
elif 'new desktop' in command_lower:
    return (new_desktop, [])

# And many more...
